# CPX MakeCode Projects
This repository hosts my projects made in Microsoft MakeCode for the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (CPX).

## Where can I get a CPX?
You can find it on Amazon, that's where I got it. You can also find it on [Adafruit's website.](https://adafruit.com/product/3333)

## What do these projects do?
**Alarm** - An alarm that reacts to shock and/or sound. When it's showing the magenta and cyan lights, pressing A or B toggles the shock and sound sensors respectively. Press both buttons at once to toggle silent mode, yellow means silenced and cyan means not silenced.
